SET Evidence = "Transcriptional activation by signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) has been shown to require the direct interaction not only with co-activators such as p300 and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) but also with nuclear co-activator 1, a member of the p160/steroid receptor co-activator family. Among the p160/steroid receptor co-activators, only p/CIP (nuclear co-activator 3) has been shown to be up-regulated by interleukin (IL)-4 in B cells through a STAT-6-dependent mechanism using Gene-Chip analysis. In this study, we have investigated the function of p/CIP in the transcriptional activation by STAT6. We found that p/CIP indirectly interacted with STAT6 via p300, and overexpression of the CBP-interacting domain of p/CIP (p/CIP(947-1084)) prevented the interaction of p/CIP with STAT6 by blocking the binding of p/CIP to p300. Whereas expression of p/CIP(947-1084) resulted in a marked reduction of STAT6-mediated transactivation, overexpression of wild type p/CIP resulted in significant enhancement of it. In addition, p/CIP(947-1084) markedly reduced CD23 expression on B cells stimulated with IL-4, whereas overexpression of wild type p/CIP enhanced it. Chromatin immunoprecipitations demonstrate that IL-4 increases the interaction of p/CIP with the murine immunoglobulin heavy chain germ line epsilon promoter in B cells. These results suggest that p/CIP positively regulates STAT6 transcriptional activation through formation of a STAT6, p300/CBP, and p/CIP complex."

SET Evidence = "The interaction of RB and E2F transcription factors represents a functional interaction that has been the predominant focus in the field. RB and the related family members p107 and p130 can each bind E2F to repress genes that are otherwise important for progression from G1 to S phase. The binding of RB, p107, or p130 has two simultaneous consequences: (1) binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and (2) binding recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes [e.g., histone deacetylases (HDACs)] to silence transcription. E2F itself is a family of transcription factors that include six E2F and three DP proteins, which together form the heterodimeric complex that comprises E2F transcriptional activity (reviewed in Trimarchi and Lees, 2002 and Yee and Wang, 2003). While there is considerable complexity, gene repression in G1 phase utilizes RB and E2Fs 1, 2, 3, and 4, while gene repression in G0 utilizes primarily p130 and E2Fs 4 and 5. binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and"

SET Evidence = "Fibrate class hypolipidemic drugs such as ciprofibrate activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), which is involved in processes including lipid metabolism and hepatocyte proliferation in rodents. We examined the effects of ciprofibrate (50 mg/kg body wt per day for 60 days) on liver gene expression in rats using cDNA microarrays. The 60-day dosing period was chosen to elucidate both the metabolic and proliferative actions of this substance, while avoiding confounding effects from the hepatic carcinogenesis seen during more long-term stimulation. Ciprofibrate changed the expression of many genes including previously known PPARalpha agonist-responsive genes involved in processes such as lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses. In addition, many novel candidate genes involved in sugar metabolism, transcription, signal transduction, cell proliferation, and stress responses appeared to be differentially regulated in ciprofibrate-dosed rats. Ciprofibrate also resulted in significant increases in liver weight and hepatocyte proliferation. The cDNA microarray results were confirmed by Northern blot analysis for selected genes. This study thus identifies many genes that appear to be differentially regulated in ciprofibrate-dosed rats, and some of these are potential targets of PPARalpha. The functional diversity of these candidate genes suggests that most of them are likely to be differentially regulated as indirect consequence of the many processes affected by ciprofibrate in rodent liver. Although caution is advisable in the interpretation of genome-wide expression data, the genes identified in the present study provide candidates for further studies that may give new insight into the mechanisms of action of peroxisome proliferators."

SET Evidence = "To investigate the cellular fate and function of polymorphonuclear neutrophilic granulocytes (PMNs) attracted to skin wounds, we used a human skin-wounding model and microarray technology to define differentially expressed genes in PMNs from peripheral blood, and PMNs that had transmigrated to skin lesions. After migration to skin lesions, PMNs demonstrated a significant transcriptional response including genes from several different functional categories. The up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes concomitant with the down-regulation of proapoptotic genes suggested a transient anti-apoptotic priming of PMNs. Among the up-regulated genes were cytokines and chemokines critical for chemotaxis of macrophages, T cells, and PMNs, and for the modulation of their inflammatory responses. PMNs in skin lesions down-regulated receptors mediating chemotaxis and anti-microbial activity, but up-regulated other receptors involved in inflammatory responses. These findings indicate a change of responsiveness to chemotactic and immunoregulatory mediators once PMNs have migrated to skin lesions and have been activated. Other effects of the up-regulated cytokines/chemokines/enzymes were critical for wound healing. These included the breakdown of fibrin clots and degradation of extracellular matrix, the promotion of angiogenesis, the migration and proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, the adhesion of keratinocytes to the dermal layer, and finally, the induction of anti-microbial gene expression in keratinocytes. Notably, the up-regulation of genes, which activate lysosomal proteases, indicate a priming of skin lesion-PMNs for degradation of phagocytosed material. These findings demonstrate that migration of PMNs to skin lesions induces a transcriptional activation program, which regulates cellular fate and function, and promotes wound healing."

SET Evidence = "To determine whether p300 is involved in inducible NO synthase (iNOS) transcriptional regulation, we evaluated the effect of p300 overexpression on iNOS expression and characterized p300 binding to iNOS promoter in RAW 264.7 cells. p300 overexpression increased iNOS expression which was abrogated by deletion of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain (Delta1472-1522). DNA-binding and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed binding of p300 to several DNA-bound transactivators at basal state. Following stimulation with LPS plus IFN-gamma, binding of p300, p50/p65 NF-kappaB, and IFN-regulatory factor-1 was increased by approximately 2-fold. Nuclear p50 was complexed with and acetylated by p300 at the basal binding state which was increased by LPS and IFN-gamma stimulation. p300 overexpression resulted in increased p50 acetylation which was reduced by HAT mutation. p50 acetylation correlated with increased NF-kappaB binding and enhanced p300 recruitment. Co-overexpression of E1A abolished the augmentation of p50 acetylation and p50 binding induced by p300 overexpression, and a correlative suppression of p300 recruitment to the complex. We conclude that p300 is essential for iNOS transcription. Our results suggest that p300 HAT acetylates the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB, thereby increasing NF-kappaB binding and NF-kappaB mediated transactivation."
